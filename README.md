Masterthesis: On mobility for COVID-19 forecasts in Germany using ordinary differential equations and graph neural networks

## Network analysis and commuter-based SIR model
The network analyis and the commuter-based SIR model was inpired, adapted and extended based on the work of:
> "COVID-19 lockdown induces structural changes in mobility networks -- Implication for mitigating disease dynamics",
> Frank Schlosser, Benjamin F. Maier, David Hinrichs, Adrian Zachariae, Dirk Brockmann,
> ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01583](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01583))

All code is self-implemented in R.

## Spatio-Temporal GNN
The spatio-temporal GNN and the evaluation scheme were adapted and extended from:
> "Transfer Graph Neural Networks for Pandemic Forecasting"
> George Panagopoulos, Giannis, Nikolentzos, Michalis Vazirgiannis,
> ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08388](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08388))

The code of this work was re-used where possible and the original code is available at: https://github.com/geopanag/pandemic_tgnn
